* Purpose *
***********

This document describes the format for .people files.  These files
represent the number of people for each rooms described by a .fp 
floorplan file.  

***************
* Conventions *
***************

This file format is in ASCII
Files of this type MUST have the suffix of *.people

**********
* Format *
**********

Each line of this file represents a room in the original floorplan.  The
value at each line indicates the estimate of the number of people in the
room.  This can be a noisy estimate, so for instance the number of computers
in the room works well.

There must be exactly NUMBER_OF_ROOMS lines in the .people file.

***********
* Example *
***********

For a floorplan with three rooms, the following is the example contents
of a .people file:

	6
	2
	3

In this file, the first room has 6 people, the second room has 2 people, 
and the third room has 3 people.
