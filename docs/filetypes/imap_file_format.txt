***********
* Purpose *
***********

This document describes the file format for .imap files, which are used
to store imagery index mappings in world coordinates.

Each file indicates which images have light-of-sight views to each 2D
position on the floor plan.

***************
* Conventions *
***************

All distances and positions are in units of meters.
All indices are zero-indexed.
All values are stored in ASCII.

**********
* Format *
**********

The file contains a header, followed by a list of 2D cells

The header is represented by the following:

	<res>			-	The resolution of the 2D cells

The remainder of the file is a list of 2D cells.  Each cell contains
a list of camera indices that can "see" that cell.  These indices are
sorted based on the quality of the line-of-sight.

Each cell is stored on a line, with the following values:

	<cx> <cy> <num_vals> <v_0> <v_1> <v_2> ... <v_(num_vals-1)>

where:

	(cx,cy)		-	The center position of the cell
	num_vals	-	The number of indices in this cell
	v_i		-	The i'th camera index that can observe 
				this cell
