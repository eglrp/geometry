*******
Purpose
*******

This format is used to express the conversion between the a global model's coordinate map and an image of that model.  The values given will convert from the image coordinates (pixels) to the model coordinates (meters).

This format was originally developed by Nicholas Corso when auto-generating screenshots of pointclouds.

******
Format
******

This file is formatted as a newline-separated ASCII file, with extension ".txt".  Only the first three lines are parsed:

	<resolution>
	<offsetX>
	<offsetY>

All remaining lines in the file are considered comments.  To map from image coordinates to model coordinates, perform the following operation:

 model_x = (image_x - offsetX)*resolution
 model_y = (image_y - offsetY)*resolution

 Image Coordinate System :
