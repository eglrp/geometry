***********
* Purpose *
***********

This file specifies the file names and timestamps of images obtained by a particular camera during data acquisition.  The file format was developed by Matthew Carlberg, specifically for the purpose of inputting camera image data to the 3d model generation code.

This format is used to represent the intrinsics and file links of any set of rectilinear camera imagery.

***************
* Conventions *
***************

The file is formatted in space-separated ASCII.
All distance and position units are in millimeters.
All indices are referenced starting at 0.

* Format *
**********

The file is formatted as:

	camSerialNum numImages
	K(0,0) K(0,1) K(0,2) K(1,0) K(1,1) K( 1,2) K(2,0) K(2,1) K(2,2)
	Rrigid (0,0) Rrigid(0,1) Rrigid(0,2) Rrigid (1,0) Rrigid(1,1) Rrigid ( 1,2) Rrigid (2,0) Rrigid (2,1) Rrigid(2,2)
	txrigid tyrigid tzÂ­rigid
	imgName1 imgTimeStamp1 
	.
	.
	.
	imgNameN imgTimeStampN
	maskName

where:

---------------------------------------------------
Field Name		Type		Description
---------------------------------------------------
camSerialNum		Integer		Serial number for camera that
					generated images referenced in
					this file

numImages		Integer		The number of images taken

K(i,j)			Decimal		The (i,j)-th component of the
					3x3 camera calibration matrix,
					where i is the row number and
					j is the column number

Rrigid(i,j)		Decimal		The (i,j)-th component of the 3x3
					rotation from camera to system
					common frame, where i is the 
					row number and j is the
					column number.

txrigid,tyrigid,	Decimal		The x, y, and z components of
tzrigid					the translation vector in
					millimeters from camera coords
					to system common coords.

imgNameJ		String		The file name of J-th image.
					There should be no spaces in the
					path of this file.

imgTimeStampJ		Decimal		The time stamp of the J-th image,
					in seconds.  This number should
					have at least three decimal places
					to specify down to the millisecond

maskName		String		The name of the mask file that is
					to be used for this camera.
