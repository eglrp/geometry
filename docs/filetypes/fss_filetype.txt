About:
------

This format specifies the scan data from laser, time-of-flight, or depth sensors after it has been time synchronized and statistically analyzed.

All values in this file are in SENSOR COORDINATES, and are independent of any localization or extrinsic calibration values.

This file format can be in binary or ascii, but it is recommendend to use binary for precision and space-efficiency reasons.  The header of the file is always in ascii.

--------------
Header Format:
--------------

The header block of the file is denoted in ASCII.  The first line is always a magic number string of 'fss' so that the file format is easily recognized.  The last line of the header is always 'end_header'.  All lines in between are formatted as space-separated strings formatted as:

	<tag> <value1> <value2> ...

The tag-lines in the header can appear in any order, but some tags are required for a valid .fss file.  The body of the file begins immediately after the new-line character at the end of 'end_header'.

These are the required header tags:

	version <float>		:	File format version number

	format <string>		:	File body format.  Allowable
					values are "ascii", "little_endian",
					or "big_endian"

	scanner_name <string>	:	Name of the scanner that produced
					this data. This name should match
					what is used in the configuration
					files produced by each dataset.

	num_scans <uint>	:	Number of scan frames contained
					in this file.  Each scan frame
					contains the same number of points
					and a timestamp in the system-synced
					clock.

	num_points_per_scan <uint>
				:	Number of points per scan frame.
					Each point contains the geometric
					information, color information, and
					statistical metadata.

	units <string>		:	The units used to represent the
					points.  Valid options are:
					"millimeters", "centimeters",
					"meters", "kilometers", "inches",
					"feet", "yards", "furlongs", "miles"

and the following optional tags:

	scanner_type <string>	:	The type of sensor used (e.g.
					"tof_camera" or "urg")

Example Header:

fss
version 1.0
format ascii
scanner_name D-Imager
scanner_type tof_camera
units meters
num_scans 1000
num_points_per_scan 14200
end_header

-----------------
File Body Format:
-----------------

The body of this file is presented as a list of scan blocks.  Each block represents one scan frame.  A block consists of the following items:

	timestamp	(quantity: 1)
	list of points	(quantity: num_points_per_scan)

Each point in the list has the following fields:

	x (x-coordinate of point position) 
	y (y-coordinate of point position)
	z (z-coordinate of point position)
	intensity (greyscale intensity value)
	bias (bias of range measurement in direction of scan)
	stddev (std. dev. of range measurement in direction of scan)
	width (lateral uncertainty in units of length)

If the format is ascii, then all values are seperated by whitespace (either spaces or new-lines).

If the format is in binary, then the values take up the following sizes:

Value			Format			Size
-----			----			----
timestamp		double			8 bytes
x			double			8 bytes
y			double			8 bytes
z			double			8 bytes
intensity		int			4 bytes
bias			double			8 bytes
stddev			double			8 bytes
width			double			8 bytes
