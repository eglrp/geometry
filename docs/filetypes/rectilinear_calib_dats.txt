Rectilinear Calibration Binary Format Specification v1.0
------------

Developed by Nicholas Corso

------------
Purpose:
------------

The calibration parameters for rectilinear lenses are 
given in the following binary format.  

All binary values are stored in little-endian ordering.

------------
Format:
------------

<magic_number> 		-	This string should always be 'KCALIB\0'.
				It serves to declare this file
				as a rectilienar calibration binary file.

<camera_name>		-	This null-terminated character string 
				gives the name of the camera.

<K_00>			-	The nine elements of the 3x3 K matrix 
<K_01>				stored in ROW-major ordering.  These are
<K_02>				stored as 8 byte doubles.
<K_10>
...
<K_22>

<kc_0>			- 	The 5 elements of the tangential distortion
<kc_1>				vector.  These are stored as 8 byte doubles.
...
<kc_4>
