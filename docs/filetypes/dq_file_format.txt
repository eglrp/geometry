* Purpose *
***********

The .dq file format is used to house information about
wall samples.  It is also used to represent 2D gridmaps
for particle filtering.  This is formatted as an ASCII file,
with the following information:

This file structure represents a Dynamic Quadtree (DQ), and
the quadtree node information is stored in the map. Since all
elements are stored at bottom-most leaf nodes, only the root-level
node meta-information is necessary.

***************
* Conventions *
***************

The file is formatted in space-separated ASCII.
All distance and position units are in meters.
All indices are referenced starting at 0.

* Format *

The following values denote the header information in the file:

  	<max_depth>		// max depth of the quadtree
 	<halfwidth>		// halfwidth of the root node
 	<x> <y>			// The root node's center position

Each cell in the tree is then represent with the following formatting,
where each cell is stored on a line in the file:

 	<x> <y> <min_z> <max_z> <num_pts> <n> <pose_1> <pose_2> ... <pose_n>

Where:

	<x> <y>		-	The position of the sample
	<min_z> <max_z> -	The height range of the sample
	<num_pts>	-	The number of points represented
	<n>		-	The number of pose indices in this cell
	<pose_i>	-	The i'th pose index number (indexed from 0)
