-------
Purpose
-------

This file contains metadata information for a list of scanorama files,
which are typically stored as .ptx files

------
Format
------

This is formatted as an ascii file.
Values are separated by whitespace.
Indexing begins at 0.

------
Header
------

The following header is given:

	scanolist		// magic number
	<num_rows> <num_cols>
	<num_poses>
	<camera0> <camera1> ... <cameraM>

Where:

	Each scanorama image is of dimension <num_rows> x <num_cols>,
	and is in column-major order.

	There are <num_poses> scanoramas listed in this file.

	The scanoramas were colored using the cameras whose names are
	given in the list <camera0> <camera1> ... <cameraM>

	After the header, there is an extra blank line.

---------
File Body
---------

After the header (and its extra blank line), each following line represents
one scanorama pose, as a space-seperated list of values:

	<index> <timestamp> <filepath>

where:

	<index>		The zero-indexed index of this pose
	<timestamp>	The timestamp of pose, in seconds (common clock)
	<filepath>	The path to the scanorama data file
