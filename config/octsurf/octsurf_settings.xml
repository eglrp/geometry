	<!-- PARAMETERS FOR NODE OUTLIER REMOVAL/SMOOTHING -->

	<!-- This value indicates the percentage of an octnode's
	     surface area that has to be touching neighboring nodes
	     with an opposite flag for that node's flag to change.

	     In other words, if an interior node was completely
	     surrounded by exterior nodes, and this value was less
	     than or equal to 1.0, then the interior node would
	     be flipped and counted as an exterior node.

	     Another example:  if an exterior node is 2/3rds surrounded
	     by interior nodes, but this value is 0.75, then the
	     exterior node would not change.  But, in the same
	     scenario, if this value was 0.5, then the exterior
	     node would be flipped.

	     Note values <= 0.5 are not stable, and should be avoided.
	     Values > 1 indicate that no flips will be made.

	     range: (0.5,1] -->
	<octsurf_node_outlierthresh>0.6</octsurf_node_outlierthresh>

	<!-- PARAMETERS FOR REGION FORMATION -->

	<!-- This value indicates how aggressive planar region
	     coalescing will be with respect to distance-from-plane.

	     The specified value indicates the number of standard
	     deviations away from the fitting plane a face center
	     can be for that face to still be considered an inlier.

	     Regions are formed by fitting a plane to a set of faces
	     and merging them together into one planar object.  If
	     a plane's face is too far from the best-fit plane, then
	     it should be considered an inlier.

	     Each face has its own statistics, including a variance
	     on its position.  The specified value will be multiplied
	     by the standard deviation of the face's position to
	     determine a distance threshold to use to determine if
	     that face is an inlier.

	     units:  standard deviations. -->
	<octsurf_coalesce_distthresh>2.0</octsurf_coalesce_distthresh>

	<!-- This value indicates how restrictive planar region
	     coalescing should be with respect to planarity of
	     the merged elements.

	     This value specifies a minimum allowed planarity.  Each
	     node face has a planarity value, which is 0 if the face
	     is not at all planar, and 1 if the face is perfectly flat.
	     Any face with a planarity below the specified value will
	     not be merged in the region growing process.

	     units:  unitless probability (in range [0,1]) -->
	<octsurf_coalesce_planethresh>0.0</octsurf_coalesce_planethresh>

	<!-- This boolean indicates which part of each node face should
	     be used to determine its position.

	     If the specified value is true (anything non-zero), then
	     the isosurface position will be computed from the node
	     face.

	     If the specified value is false (i.e. 0), then
	     the discretized grid face position will be used. -->
	<octsurf_use_isosurface_pos>0</octsurf_use_isosurface_pos>

	<!-- The minimum allowed magnitude for singular values
	     when decomposing the intersections of planes.

	     This value is used when determine when a set of planes
	     intersect.  If two or more planes are close to being
	     parallel, the singular value of the matrix made up
	     of the plane normals will be very small.  This threshold
	     indicates how small it can get before the two parallel
	     planes will be processed as if they were one plane.

	     range:  [0,1] (please keep it small) -->
	<octsurf_min_singular_value>0.1</octsurf_min_singular_value>

	<!-- The maximum allowed dot-product magnitude of adjacent
	     edges during the region boundary simplification process.

	     If the dot product between two edges are below this value,
	     then they are candidates for simplification.  Edges whose
	     dot product magnitude is greater than this value will
	     not be simplified.

	     Note that the dot product uses normalized edge lengths,
	     so this value represents the cosine of the max allowed
	     angle.

	     Here are some common mappings for cosine:
	     	
			5 degrees 	0.9962
			8 degrees	0.9902
			10 degrees      0.9848

	     range:  [0,1] -->
	<octsurf_max_colinearity>0.999</octsurf_max_colinearity>
