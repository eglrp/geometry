	<!-- This value indicates the limit resolution to use when carving
	     the volume defined by sensor scans.  Setting this parameter
	     to a smaller value will produce models with more detail, but
	     will take more processing time and memory.

	     Units: meters -->
	<procarve_resolution>0.125</procarve_resolution>

	<!-- This value indicates the number of threads to use during
	     carving when importing chunk data.
	    
	     If not specified, the value used will be 1. -->
	<procarve_num_threads>4</procarve_num_threads>

	<!-- This value indicates how far to carve past each scan point
	     when performing volumetric analysis.  The volume just past
	     the position of a point can be labeled as solid with some
	     certainty, and this parameter indicates how far back to
	     provide that labeling.  It uses the uncertainty in the
	     position of the point in order to increase robustness.

	     This value is in units of standard deviation of the point
	     position.  So, the actual distance carved may vary from
	     point-to-point, but will be scaled by this amount. -->
	<procarve_carvebuf>3.0</procarve_carvebuf>

	<!-- This value indicates the size of chunks that are generated
	     by the scan_chunker program.  The size of a chunk will not
	     affect the output model, only the processing speed and memory
	     usage.
	     
	     Each chunk represents a cube in space that can be processed
	     independently.  Larger chunks require more memory to hold,
	     whereas smaller chunks will increase the number of total
	     computations and also reduce the programs ability to
	     simplify the model.

	     The chunksize is measured in meters, and a value that
	     indicates the general expected feature-length of the
	     model is recommended.  That is, if the model contains
	     huge open areas, it is recommended to increase the chunk size,
	     but if the model is only composed of tight spaces, then
	     a smaller chunk size is recommended.  These recommendations
	     are only for processing-efficiency purposes, and again,
	     will not affect the quality of the output model. -->

	<!-- This value represents where on disk the chunk files are stored.
	     The directory specified is relative to the location of the
	     chunklist file given to the program.  So, for example, if
	     the following chunklist file is specified:

	        chunklist file:     foo/bar/list.chunklist
	        procarve_chunkdir:  baz/chunks

	     Then the chunks will be written to:

	        final directory:    foo/bar/baz/chunks/
	     
	     If left blank, the chunk files will be put in the same
	     directory as the chunklist file. -->

	<!-- This value represents the default uncertainty of a sensor's
	     timestamp value.  This is represented as the standard
	     deviation of the error in the timestamps of a sensor. Most
	     sensors will be able to generate this value automatically,
	     but if for some sensors, we need a default level of uncertainty
	     to use.

	     This is measured in units of seconds.  It is recommended to
	     keep it at a few milliseconds, since that is the level of
	     precision that most sensors use when timestamping. -->

	<!-- This value represents the line-fit distance parameter.  Line
	     fitting occurs when looking for planarity elements within
	     the scan frames.  A large value will allow this fitting to
	     be robust to noise, but will ignore small line segments.  A
	     small value will be less robust to noise, but will capture
	     the local linearity of small line segments within a scan.
