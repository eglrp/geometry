	<!-- The dimensions of the scanorama grid.

	     These value indicate how many rows and columns are exported 
	     in each scanorama.  Each scanorama is stored as a gridded 
	     point cloud, stored in column-major order.

	     These dimensions should be roughly the same as the height
	     and width of the input imagery used to color the scanorama.
	     If the scanorama dimensions are larger, then it will take up
	     a lot of disk space without any additional fidelity.  If
	     the scanorama dimensions are smaller, then it will save disk
	     space, but the output scanorama will be low-res and may have
	     some aliasing effects.

	<!-- The blending width when combining imagery from multiple cameras

	     When colors are imported into a scanorama from camera imagery,
	     they may need to be blended if multiple cameras overlap the
	     same viewing angle.  This value determines how wide of a strip
	     to blend between the cameras.  Values outside of this strip
	     will be taken from just the best camera.

	     The value should be in the range [0,1], and is based off of
	     the cosine of the angle.  If the value is specified as zero,
	     then no blending will occur.  If the value is specified as
	     1, then a huge amount of blending will occur.

	     range: [0,1] -->
	<scanorama_blendwidth>0.1</scanorama_blendwidth>

	<!-- The spacing distance between successive scanorama poses.

	     Rather than export a scanorama at the pose of every single
	     camera image, we can instead downsample the output to
	     only export scanoramas that are at least this distance apart.

	     If the value is set to negative, then every camera pose will
	     be exported.
