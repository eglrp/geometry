	<!-- The dimensions of the scanorama grid.

	     These value indicate how many rows and columns are exported 
	     in each scanorama.  Each scanorama is stored as a gridded 
	     point cloud, stored in column-major order.

	     These dimensions should be roughly the same as the height
	     and width of the input imagery used to color the scanorama.
	     If the scanorama dimensions are larger, then it will take up
	     a lot of disk space without any additional fidelity.  If
	     the scanorama dimensions are smaller, then it will save disk
	     space, but the output scanorama will be low-res and may have
	     some aliasing effects.

	<!-- The blending width when combining imagery from multiple cameras

	     When colors are imported into a scanorama from camera imagery,
	     they may need to be blended if multiple cameras overlap the
	     same viewing angle.  This value determines how wide of a strip
	     to blend between the cameras.  Values outside of this strip
	     will be taken from just the best camera.

	     The value should be in the range [0,1], and is based off of
	     the cosine of the angle.  If the value is specified as zero,
	     then no blending will occur.  If the value is specified as
	     1, then a huge amount of blending will occur.

	     range: [0,1] -->
	<scanorama_blendwidth>0.1</scanorama_blendwidth>

	<!-- The range of spacing distance between successive 
	     scanorama poses.

	     Rather than export a scanorama at the pose of every single
	     camera image, we can instead downsample the output to
	     only export scanoramas that are at least this distance apart.

	     We specify a min and max spacing so that there are a range of
	     potential poses within an appropriate distance.  Of this range,
	     the best pose is chosen.  All successive scanorama poses will
	     be spaced within this range of each other.

	     If the values are set to negative, then every camera pose will
	     be exported.

	<scanorama_max_spacing_dist>3.5</scanorama_max_spacing_dist>	

	<!-- The following specify which file formats to export
	     for each scanorama position.  Each format is togglable
	     so that multiple files can be exported for each pose
	     at once.

	     If '0', then the specified format will not be exported.
	     If '1', then the specified format will be exported.
