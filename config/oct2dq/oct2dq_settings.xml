	<!-- This value indicates how aggressive planar region
	     coalescing will be with respect to distance-from-plane.

	     The specified value indicates the number of standard
	     deviations away from the fitting plane a face center
	     can be for that face to still be considered an inlier.

	     Regions are formed by fitting a plane to a set of faces
	     and merging them together into one planar object.  If
	     a plane's face is too far from the best-fit plane, then
	     it should be considered an inlier.

	     Each face has its own statistics, including a variance
	     on its position.  The specified value will be multiplied
	     by the standard deviation of the face's position to
	     determine a distance threshold to use to determine if
	     that face is an inlier.

	<!-- This value indicates how restrictive planar region
	     coalescing should be with respect to planarity of
	     the merged elements.

	     This value specifies a minimum allowed planarity.  Each
	     node face has a planarity value, which is 0 if the face
	     is not at all planar, and 1 if the face is perfectly flat.
	     Any face with a planarity below the specified value will
	     not be merged in the region growing process.

	     the isosurface position will be computed from the node
	     face.

	<!-- *********************************************** -->

	<!-- The following specifies the verticality strictness
	     for determining which surfaces should contribute to
	     wall samples.

	     This value is a threshold for the dot-product of the
	     normal of a surface with the z-vector.  Surfaces will
	     only be considered vertical if the following inequality
	     is met:

	     abs(surface_normal.dot(<0,0,1>)) < verticalitythresh

	     Just for reference, here's a few examples:

	     	0.0	==>	0 degree variation from horizontal
		0.087	==>	5 degree variation from horizontal

	     in the environment that are vertically aligned and
	     large.  This parameter indicates the minimum-allowed
	     surface area for each candidate region.

	     NOTE: this threshold is only used for vertical surfaces.
	     A separate surface area threshold is used for horizontally

	<!-- The following specifies a minimum height for walls

	     Wall surfaces will only contribute to wall sampling
	     if their vertical extent is at least this much.  This
	     threshold is applied in parallel with the surface area
	     threshold, so any regions used must pass both
	     independently.

	     Floors and ceilings are generated by finding planar regions
	     in the environment that are horizontally aligned and large.
	     This parameter specifies the minimum-allowed surface area for
	     each candidate floor/ceiling.
