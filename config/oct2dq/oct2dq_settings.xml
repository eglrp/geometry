	<!-- This value indicates how aggressive planar region
	     coalescing will be with respect to distance-from-plane.

	     The specified value indicates the number of standard
	     deviations away from the fitting plane a face center
	     can be for that face to still be considered an inlier.

	     Regions are formed by fitting a plane to a set of faces
	     and merging them together into one planar object.  If
	     a plane's face is too far from the best-fit plane, then
	     it should be considered an inlier.

	     Each face has its own statistics, including a variance
	     on its position.  The specified value will be multiplied
	     by the standard deviation of the face's position to
	     determine a distance threshold to use to determine if
	     that face is an inlier.

	     units:  standard deviations. -->

	<!-- This value indicates how restrictive planar region
	     coalescing should be with respect to planarity of
	     the merged elements.

	     This value specifies a minimum allowed planarity.  Each
	     node face has a planarity value, which is 0 if the face
	     is not at all planar, and 1 if the face is perfectly flat.
	     Any face with a planarity below the specified value will
	     not be merged in the region growing process.

	     the isosurface position will be computed from the node
	     face.

	     the discretized grid face position will be used. -->

	<!-- The following specifies the verticality strictness

	     only be considered vertical if the following inequality
	     is met:

	     abs(surface_normal.dot(<0,0,1>)) < verticalitythresh

	     Just for reference, here's a few examples:

	     Wall surfaces will only contribute to wall sampling
