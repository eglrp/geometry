	<!-- This value indicates the number of iterations to run
	     when attempting to optimize the floorplan's alignment
	     with the carved octree.  This alignment process will be
	     performed using gradient descent.  A larger value here will
	     allow for more aggressive alignment, but will take a longer
	     time.

	     units:  number of alignment cycles -->
	<fp_opt_iterations>5</fp_opt_iterations>

	<!-- This value indicates the maximum search range for a floorplan
	     surface to be moved within a single iteration when attempting
	     to align it to the octree carving.  This value should express
	     the expected error of a floorplan surface position. Since the
	     alignment process is used to find furniture and other objects
	     in the carving, this value should be smaller than the feature
	     length of any desired object in the environment.

	     units: meters -->
	<fp_opt_search_range>0.05</fp_opt_search_range>

	<!-- This value indicates the offset step size when searching
	     for the optimal wall position within an optimization
	     iteration.  This value is in units of the resolution of
	     the octree.  So, for example, if the value was 1, then
	     the wall offset would be moved by one tree resolution at
	     each step.
	     
	     Note that a preferred value should be less than one, to
	     account for non-axis-aligned walls, but does not need to
	     be significantly less than one, since it is still searching
	     on a discretized volume.

	     Units:   number of tree resolutions -->
	<fp_opt_offset_step_coeff>0.25</fp_opt_offset_step_coeff>
