	<!-- This value indicates the number of iterations to run
	     when attempting to optimize the floorplan's alignment
	     with the carved octree.  This alignment process will be
	     performed using gradient descent.  A larger value here will
	     allow for more aggressive alignment, but will take a longer
	     time.

	     units:  number of alignment cycles -->
	<fp_opt_iterations>3</fp_opt_iterations>

	<!-- This value indicates the maximum search range for a floorplan
	     surface to be moved within a single iteration when attempting
	     to align it to the octree carving.  This value should express
	     the expected error of a floorplan surface position. Since the
	     alignment process is used to find furniture and other objects
	     in the carving, this value should be smaller than the feature
	     length of any desired object in the environment.

	     units: meters -->
	<fp_opt_search_range>0.1</fp_opt_search_range>

	<!-- This value indicates the offset step size when searching
	     for the optimal wall position within an optimization
	     iteration.  This value is in units of the resolution of
	     the octree.  So, for example, if the value was 1, then
	     the wall offset would be moved by one tree resolution at
	     each step.
	     
	     Note that a preferred value should be less than one, to
	     account for non-axis-aligned walls, but does not need to
	     be significantly less than one, since it is still searching
	     on a discretized volume.

	     Units:   number of tree resolutions -->
	<fp_opt_offset_step_coeff>0.25</fp_opt_offset_step_coeff>
	
	<!-- This value represents the geometric base value
	     for the optimization process.

	     In other words, it represents how much of a bonus
	     a particular surface offset should get based on the
	     difference from the last offset.  The advantage of
	     awarding a bonus in these situations is to give
	     advantage to the smallest offset to produce a certain
	     cost, and not any subsequent offsets.

	     A value of 0 gives no bonus, and just selects the
	     offset with the lowest raw cost (this will typically
	     make the output floorplan too shrunken).  A value
	     of 1 gives full bonus of the previous delta.

	     units:  unitless, in range [0,1] -->
	<fp_opt_delta_cost_bonus>0.5</fp_opt_delta_cost_bonus>

	<!-- If this value is set to true (any non-zero value),
	     then the horizontal wall positions in the floorplan
	     will be optimized as part of this optimization
	     procedure.

	     If the value is set to false (i.e. zero), then the
	     horizontal wall positions will be modified.

	     value:  boolean (either '0' or '1') -->
	<fp_opt_do_walls>0</fp_opt_do_walls>

	<!-- If this value is set to true (any non-zero value),
	     then the vertical floor and ceiling positions in the floorplan
	     will be optimized as part of this optimization
	     procedure.

	     If the value is set to false (i.e. zero), then the
	     vertical positions will be modified.

	     value:  boolean (either '0' or '1') -->
	<fp_opt_do_heights>1</fp_opt_do_heights>

	<!-- This value indicates the relative amount of refinement
	     octree nodes that contain objects or furniture should
	     receive.  This value represents a relative depth in the
	     octree.  Object nodes will be carved this many levels
	     deeper than other areas.

	     If this value is zero, then no refinement will occur.

	     units:  number of octree levels -->
	<object_refine_depth>2</object_refine_depth>

	<!-- This value indicates whether to use interpolated wedges
	     when recarving chunks marked for refinement.  Using
	     interpolated wedges will take longer, but result
	     in more accurate geometry.

	     It is highly recommended to use interpolated wedges
	     here if the original procarve used interpolated wedges.

	     value:  boolean (either '0' or '1') -->
